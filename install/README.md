# Linking to an existing CMake project

This folder contains an independent CMake project that illustrates how to use the installation of BitGraph. By default, Bitgraph is deployed in the current [install](https://github.com/psanse/BitGraph/tree/master/install) folder, and the child [src](https://github.com/psanse/BitGraph/tree/master/install/src) folder contains two target source code files that use BitGraph. The CMake code uses `find_package(BitGraph CONFIG REQUIRED)` to look for the  configuration files generated by CMake in the *BitGraph/install/lib/cmake/BitGraph* folder during the installation. In order to use BitGraph, the critical CMake code is as follows:

```plaintext
find_package(BitGraph CONFIG REQUIRED)     #set the install path of BitGraph in the variable BitGraph_dir

# target graph_example
add_executable(graph_example src/graph.cpp)

target_link_libraries (graph_example LINK_PUBLIC 
    BitGraph::graph
    BitGraph::bitscan
    BitGraph::utils				)

```
# Standalone CMake Project
For `find_package` to succeed, the CMake variable `BitGraph_DIR` must be set to the installation path (*BitGraph/install/lib/cmake/BitGraph* in this example). To build the appropiate CMake scripts for this CMake project, from the BitGraph ROOT folder (and after the default installation of BitGraph) proceed as follows: 

```plaintext
cd install
mkdir build
cmake .. -DBitGraph_DIR=./lib/cmake/BitGraph

```
Finally, compile the code appropiately in Windows (building the corresponding projects with extension`.vproj`) or in *nix systems with `make`.
