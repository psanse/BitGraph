/** 
 * @file graph.h
 * @brief  Header file for the main facade graph types of the BitGraph library  to be used by consumer code
 *		    
 * @notes:
 *	BitGraph is an efficient C++ library for simple graphs.
 *	BitGraph stores the adjacency matrix in full, where each row is encoded as a
 *	bitstring. BitGraph is at the core of a number of state-of-the-art-leading 
 *	exact algorithms for NP-hard problems.
