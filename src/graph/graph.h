 * @brief  The one-and-only header file for the main facade graph types of the BitScan library
 *         To be used by consumer code
 *		    
 * @comment: BitGraph is an efficient C++ library for simple graphs
 *			 BitGraph stores the adjacency matrix un full and each row is encoded as a
 *			 bitstring. BitGraph is at the core of a number of state-of-the-art-leading 
 *			 exact algorithms for NP-hard problems.
